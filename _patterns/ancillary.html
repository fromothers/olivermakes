  ## Ancillary content

  A Liquid `capture` tag can be used to capture a variable, and then a Liquid filter can process Markdown text into an HTML block. For example, wrap the text in `{% capture ancillary %}` and `{% endcapture %}` and then `{{ ancillary | markdownify }}`.

<aside class="ancillary">
{{ page.include_markdown | markdownify }}
</aside>

Content flows after or around the `<aside>` block. The `.ancillary` block should be used for content that is related to the main body but not necessarily as important – supporting the main story without being directly a part of it. This paragraph represents the layout and style of main body content.

Use with a captured `ancillary` value and insert with `{% raw %}{% include block/ancillary.html %}{% endraw %}`.
