# Services

I’m [Oliver Pattison](/about/), a designer who makes responsive, forward-thinking websites. Here is how I can help you craft a website.
{:.focus}


Budget-constrained web projects often rely on commodified design, but they deserve more. Commodified services are selling ready-made templates and patterns, but they can’t help you stand out from the crowd. People should tell their stories. Design should be bold and memorable. In my work, I dissent against sameness and mediocrity in design and communication. Your story is unique, and the people you want to connect with value your personal touch — why should your web presence be any different?

As an independent designer and developer, I can work with you to craft designs uniquely suited to your project’s needs. I can lead a project from start to finish, from planning and conceptualization to coding and implementation. And because I work alone or with a lean team, I can still keep costs low.
