# Available for hire

I’m [Oliver Pattison](https://olivermak.es/about/), a designer who makes responsive, forward-thinking websites. I bring a multi-disciplinary set of skills to every project that I work on.
{:.focus}

{% capture first %}
### Full-time role

I am looking for a design role that requires both design and development expertise. I am also seeking non-profits or businesses who want to enhance their websites and other outward-facing projects.

This might look like a “web designer” or “front-end developer” role, though my experience is wider than those terms suggest, and as a generalist I am happy to work outside and in between those boundaries.

### Part-time or contract role

I am available to provide design and light development work for small projects (or as a small part of a larger team).

I do not charge an hourly rate, but rather a fair amount based on amount of work and exclusive commitment required within a span of time (typically per week).
{% endcapture %}

{% capture third %}
### Side projects and collaboration

I am interested in providing design, prototyping, or other assistance for open source projects that solve interesting problems, communicate provocative ideas, or promote social justice.

  <li class="details-item">
    <button class="details-expand">HTML and CSS</button>

    <p class="details-expanded">I have a passion for well-written, thoughtful HTML and CSS. Although it is often dismissed as a simple markup language, getting HTML right is challenging, both when dealing with visual design and accessibility and usability.</p>
  </li>

  <li class="details-item">
    <button class="details-expand">Jekyll</button>

    <p class="details-expanded">Jekyll is my favorite tool for designing and publishing content on the web. Most of the sites that I build these days are static sites (using Jekyll), with minimal but flexible configuration and high performance.</p>
  </li>

  <li class="details-item">
    <button class="details-expand">JavaScript</button>

    <p class="details-expanded">I have been learning JavaScript for the past few years, working on interactive user interfaces and enhancing projects.</p>
  </li>

  <li class="details-item">
    <button class="details-expand">Web publishing systems</button>

    <p class="details-expanded">I have designed and developed sites with Shopify, Statamic, WordPress, and other content management systems. My focus has been on integrating front-end design with content editing systems, and organizing content structures for editors.</p>
  </li>

</ul>
