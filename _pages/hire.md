## What makes me unique?

- Passionate about the web as a medium.
- A self-taught self-starter.
- An experienced digital professional with a client perspective.
- A skilled writer, educator, and communicator.
- Forward-thinking: an early adopter of responsive web design (way back in 2010) and static site generators like Jekyll.
- A fine balance between design and front-end development skills.

  <h2>My skills and interests</h2>

  <div class="skills-item">
  <h3>HTML and CSS</h3>
  <p>I have a passion for well-written, thoughtful HTML and CSS. Although it is often dismissed as a simple markup language, getting HTML right is challenging, both when dealing with visual design and accessibility and usability.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="skills-item">
  <h3>Jekyll</h3>
  <p>Jekyll is my favorite tool for designing and publishing content on the web. Most of the sites that I build these days are static sites (using Jekyll), with minimal but flexible configuration and high performance.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="skills-item">
  <h3>Web publishing systems</h3>
  <p>I have designed and developed sites with Shopify, Statamic, WordPress, and other content management systems. My focus has been on integrating front-end design with content editing systems, and organizing content structures for editors.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="skills-item">
  <h3>JavaScript</h3>
  <p>I have been learning JavaScript for the past few years, working on interactive user interfaces and enhancing projects.</p>
  </div>
