This is an experiment in [photography and storytelling](https://jeanandoliver.space) by me and Jean Flanagan. The first iteration of it collects photos from our fall 2016 trip and wedding in Vermont. This project was implemented using [fluid typography]({% post_url 2017-02-01-fluid-typography %}) and [fluid grids]({% post_url 2017-01-30-fluid-grid %}).

{% assign image = page.image[1] %}
{% include block/image.html class="image--wide" %}

{% assign image = page.image[2] %}
{% include block/image.html class="image--wide" %}

The siteâ€™s design is based on a slightly asymmetric layout. Images are laid out in masonry-like grid, with images fitting together precisely with thin gutters.
