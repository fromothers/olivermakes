There can never be enough legible, intentionally designed syntax themes for text editors. I designed [newbound light](https://github.com/opattison/newbound-light-syntax) (as well as its [dark](https://github.com/opattison/newbound-dark-syntax) and [warm](https://github.com/opattison/newbound-warm-syntax) alternatives) as a theme for [Atom](https://atom.io), based on the hues and shades from this website. Optimized for writing Markdown and for front-end development, it should also work with other syntaxes. The light theme is intended for general use where high but not harsh contrast (maximum ratio around 11:1) is desired. The dark and warm themes are better suited for late night work, and are intentionally slightly lower contrast (typically between 4.5:1 and 10:1).

Working with Atom as my primary text editor, I spend a lot of time looking at syntax-highlighted code. I carefully designed [color palettes](/patterns/color/) while creating my own website. I tweaked and refined those palettes for a pleasing, legible set of syntax theme colors. Leaning heavily on the existing syntax support and syntax themes built into Atom, I made adjustments to work especially well with Markdown, HTML, and CSS which I use for every project. I tested the themes thoroughly, lived with them for a while, and then published open source versions. I now use these syntax themes every day.

All three palettes can be used as [base16](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16) themes, since they were designed with similar constraints. However, my syntax themes were made by hand for the most part, and do not strictly adhere to base16 styling guidelines. base16 is a wonderful design constraint (eight hues, eight shades) but its typical application for light themes tends to be a bit of an afterthought and often results in [illegible levels of contrast](https://chriskempson.github.io/base16/), which is partly why I decided to create my own light theme in the first place.

The name for this design comes from the track “newbound” by Autechre on their 2013 EP [L-event](https://warp.net/releases/l-event/).
